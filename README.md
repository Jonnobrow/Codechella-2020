## üìã About the Project

After brainstorming ideas, we decided unanimously on a Smart Assistant application that would allow
users to interact with Twitter in a meaningful way. Current offerings for Twitter "skills" on Amazon
Alexa are limited in what they can do and are rated poorly on the store. 

Therefore we decide to create a skill, and the supporting API, to allow users to do the following:
- Get a summary of tweets in a Hashtag
- Get the latest tweets from a User
- Follow a user
- Get the topics trending in your area

### How it applied to '\#BuildWithTwitter'

We are using the [Twitter API v2](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/early-access) to:
- Get Tweets based on a Hashtag
- Get Tweets from a user
- Follow a user
- Get trending topics

### How it applies to 'Twitter for Everyone'

This smart assistant application will hopefully open up Twitter to a whole new demographic.
People with visual impairments may struggle when using Twitter on a conventional mobile app or website.
A smart assistant allows users to interact with Twitter purely through voice and we wanted to implement
features we feel are key to the Twitter experience.

## üîí Secrets (API Keys etc)

**DO NOT COMMIT SECRETS TO THE GIT REPOSITORY!**
**EDIT THE SAMPLE FILE AND DOCUMENTATION BELOW TO EXPLAIN WHAT SECRETS ARE EXPECTED INSTEAD.**


Secrets are stored in the `src/config.py`.
You can find a sample of this file in `src/config.sample.py`.
This should be copied to `src/config.py` and the values should be updated to use
those provided by the Twitter API and any other service used.
